This React app utilizes Tailwind CSS and the Pixabay API to pull in a gallery of images, each with an associated photographer, number of likes, number of views, and number of downloads. 

Images are brought in randomly on first load, but users can use the search box at the top to tailor their results. Additionally, clicking a tag beneath a photo will set the search term. 

Users can also click the image to be taken to its location in the photographer's profile, or the photographer's name to be taken to their profile.
